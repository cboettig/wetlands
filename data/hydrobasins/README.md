# HydroBasins Global Watershed Boundaries

## Overview

This directory contains processed global watershed boundary data from HydroBasins, organized by hierarchical basin levels. The data has been compiled from multiple continental datasets into unified global layers.

## Data Source

**Original Data:** HydroSHEDS HydroBasins v1c  
**Source URL:** https://www.hydrosheds.org/products/hydrobasins  
**Download Date:** December 2, 2025  
**Data Version:** v1c  
**Spatial Reference:** WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)  

## Description

HydroBasins provides a series of polygon layers that depict watershed boundaries at different hierarchical levels (also known as Pfafstetter levels). Level 1 represents the largest continental-scale basins, while Level 12 represents the finest sub-basin delineations.

The dataset uses the Pfafstetter coding system, which provides a systematic method for assigning IDs to hydrographic units based on the topology of the drainage network.

## Geographic Coverage

The compiled dataset includes HydroBasins data from all available continents:
- Africa (af)
- Arctic (ar)
- Asia (as)
- Australia/Oceania (au)
- Europe (eu)
- Greenland (gr)
- North America (na)
- South America (sa)
- Siberia (si)

Global extent: Longitude -180° to 180°, Latitude -55.99° to 83.63°

### Source Shapefiles

The original downloaded shapefiles are organized in continent-specific subdirectories:
```
africa/          - African basins (levels 01-12)
arctic/          - Arctic region basins (levels 01-12)
asia/            - Asian basins (levels 01-12)

## Data Processing

### Processing Date
December 2, 2025

### Processing Steps

1. **Download:** Retrieved HydroBasins v1c shapefiles for all 9 continents from hydrosheds.org
2. **Extraction:** Unzipped all continental datasets (108 shapefiles total: 9 continents × 12 levels)
3. **Consolidation:** Merged continental datasets by level into unified global layers
4. **GeoPackage Creation:** Combined all levels into a single multi-layer GeoPackage
5. **GeoParquet Export:** Generated individual GeoParquet files for each level

### Tools Used
- `wget` - Data download
- `unzip` - Archive extraction  
- `ogr2ogr` (GDAL 3.x) - Shapefile to GeoPackage conversion
- `geopandas` (Python) - GeoParquet generation
- `pyarrow` - Parquet file writing

## Usage Examples

### Load GeoPackage in Python
```python
import geopandas as gpd

# Read a specific level
basins = gpd.read_file('combined_hydrobasins.gpkg', layer='level_06')

# List all layers
import fiona
with fiona.open('combined_hydrobasins.gpkg') as src:
    print(src.listlayers())
```

### Load GeoParquet in Python
```python
import geopandas as gpd

# Read a specific level (faster than GeoPackage)
basins = gpd.read_parquet('level_06.parquet')
```

### Load in R
```r
library(sf)

# Read from GeoPackage
basins <- st_read("combined_hydrobasins.gpkg", layer = "level_06")

# Read from GeoParquet
library(arrow)
basins <- read_parquet("level_06.parquet") %>% st_as_sf()
```

### Query with DuckDB
```sql
-- Query GeoParquet directly
SELECT HYBAS_ID, SUB_AREA, UP_AREA, PFAF_ID 
FROM read_parquet('level_08.parquet')
WHERE UP_AREA > 10000
ORDER BY UP_AREA DESC;
```

## Choosing the Right Level

- **Levels 1-3:** Global to continental-scale analysis, biogeographic studies
- **Levels 4-6:** Regional watershed analysis, large-scale hydrological modeling
- **Levels 7-9:** Watershed-scale ecosystem analysis, medium-resolution modeling
- **Levels 10-12:** Detailed sub-basin analysis, high-resolution hydrological studies

## Notes

- The GeoPackage format includes some MULTIPOLYGON geometries in POLYGON layers, which is handled by the GDAL driver but may produce warnings.
- GeoParquet files are more efficient for cloud-based analysis and selective spatial queries.
- All data uses WGS 84 geographic coordinates (EPSG:4326).
